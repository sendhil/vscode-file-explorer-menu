# VSCode File Explorer Menu

This extension attempts to mimic the menu feature from the Vim [NERDTree](https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree) plugin.

The extension includes one command `vscodeFileExplorerMenu.openFileExplorerMenu` which can be triggered through the normal command menu, but I recommend you bind it to a key scoped to file explorer menu for quick access.
